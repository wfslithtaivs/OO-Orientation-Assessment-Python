Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

   Object-orientation require next 3 things:

    Abstraction - allows to abstract certain logic.

    Incapsulation - allows to abstract complicated object-behaviour.

    Polymorphism - allows using "generally alike" objects similar ways
    without any knowledge of implementation details.

2. What is a class?

    Class in Python is a specific data type that subclasses (by default) Class Object
    and abstract certain behaviour pattern.
    Designed to implement object-oriented concepts.

3. What is an instance attribute?

    Any attribute that might be accessed using following syntax:
        class_instance.attribute_name

    Depends on context might return instance specific value
    or value for higher level class (up to Object) one.

4. What is a method?

    Method is a function belongs to a specific class.

5. What is an instance in object orientation?

    Instance in OO is an object of a specific class.

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.

   Class attribute belongs to class and might be accessed by instances of class.
   Instance attribute belongs to instance of class and can't accessed from class level.

   Usage:
    class attribute count keeps track of number of class instances ever created.

    instance attribute name stores specific name of cat of class Cat.
